This project simulates news-based sentiment analysis by assigning a random sentiment score (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) to different financial assets. It mimics AI-like functionality, giving the illusion of real-time sentiment analysis based on market news, while using randomly generated data or pre-defined text samples.

The goal is to introduce AI-like features into a trading or financial dashboard without requiring complex machine learning models.
